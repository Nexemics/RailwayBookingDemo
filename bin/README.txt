Bookings and Server files have been saved which contains dynamic entry of multiple passengers however 
I have failed to figure out why I cannot insert the primary key data into bookid referencing bookid in bookings table
and decided to reduce it into single passenger per booking since there is less time for submission
So this is just a back up.
